## Introduction 
In this lab we used Nessus, a widely known security tool, it plays a pivotal role in pinpointing and managing vulnerabilities within an organizations IT infrastructure. It harnesses an extensive repository of known security weaknesses to evaluate systems for potential risks. With its capability to automate scans and the flexibility to tailor them to specific assets or compliance requirements, Nessus produces in depth reports that help security teams efficiently address vulnerabilities. Known for its precision and extensive coverage, Nessus is compatible with various platforms and is highly regarded for enhancing cybersecurity resilience. 

## Architecture Before Scanning with Nessus
For this lab, we're using VMware to create a virtual machine that will be hosting a Windows 10 operating system. The first step involves setting up the virtual environment in VMware to serve as our testing platform. Following that, we'll install and configure the Windows 10 operating system within this virtual machine. Once Windows 10 is operational, we'll proceed to deploy Nessus vulnerability scanner, enabling us to assess the security of the Windows 10 virtual environment in a controlled setting. This hands-on experience will provide practical insights into utilizing Nessus for vulnerability scanning on Windows systems. 

## Initial Scan

After the initial scan with the Nessus vulnerability scanner on our Windows 10 system, it revealed the presence of several vulnerabilities within our environment. These findings highlight areas of potential security risks that need immediate attention and remediation. It's essential that we carefully review the detailed Nessus report to identify and understand the specific vulnerabilities detected. This information will guide us in developing a comprehensive plan to address and mitigate these security weaknesses effectively. 

## Downloading an insecure/ outdated application 

To further my understanding of Nessus, instead of remediating the vulnerabilities detected during the inital Nessus scan, I downloaded an outdated version of the Firefox search engine. This led to a significant increase in the number of vulnerabilities within our system. The use of outdated software can introduce various security risks as these versions lack essential patches and updated. This scenario underscores the importance of promptly addressing and resolving vulnerabilties to maintain a secure IT environment, as neglecting them can exacerbate security concerns. 

## Remediating vulnerabilties 
Entering the remediation phase, two primary actions were taken to address the vulnerabilities detected in our system. Firstly, the outdated version of Firefox was uninstalled, eliminating a potential security risk associated with using deprecated software. Secondly, the Windows operating system was updated, ensuring that it received the latest security patches and improvements. Following these actions, a substantial reduction in the number of vulnerabilities was observed. This outcome underscores the importance of proactively addressing security weaknesses through the removal of deprecated software and keeping the system up to date, contributing to a more robust and secure IT environment. 

## Final Scan

In the final scan conducted after remediation, our system did exhibit some vulnerabilities, which is an anticipated outcome in the realm of cybersecurity. Achieving absolute security is an elusive goal, as new vulnerabilties can emerge, and the threat landscape is constantly evolving. Nevertheless, the significant reduction in vulnerabilties compared to the initial scan indicated our proactive actions, such as removing deprecated software and updating the system, have substantially improved the overall security posture. It's crucial to recognize that cybersecurity is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and proactive measures are necessary to mitigate risk and adapt to the ever-changing security landscape. 

## Conclusion 
In this project, we underwent a process to assess and enhance the security of our IT environment using the nessus vulnerability scanner. We began by conducting an initial scan, which uncovered a range of vulnerabilities in our system. Rather than immediately remediating them, I installed an outdated version of the Firefox search engine, leading to a significant increase in vulnerabilities. This illustrated the risk of neglecting security concerns and reinforced the importance of proactive measures.

Moving into a remediation phase, we uninstalled the deprecated Firefox version and updated the Windows operating system. This resulted in a substantial reduction in vulnerabilties, underscoring the importance of addressing security weaknesses through these actions. Our final scan showed that, while some vulnerabilties persisted, they are a reminder that achieving absolute security is a perpetual challenge. Nonetheless, our proactive approach significantly bolstered our security posture, emphasizing that cybersecurity is an ongoing journey, requiring vigilance, adaptability, and continuous efforts to maintain a resilient and secure IT environment.
